simply put nt work rosetta stone claims design software based idea learn second language way learned first one socalled immersion first using rosetta stone hardly qualifies immersion secondly anyone studied second language acquisition knows adults learn language children may sound easy us nt remember much learning first language think commonsense perspective realize even tenyear old native speaking child still makes many errors want spend ten years trying learn second language second language acquisition programs take account fact adults many language cognitive skills employ language study children welldeveloped program would account use learner advantage rosetta stone thisfrom motivational standpoint also discouraging program others said nt teach communicate pimsleur audio programs still limited ways advantage teaching language allows immediate conversation immediate conversation people nt know well found encouraging able use turkish learned first lesson strike conversation turkish man met international dinner university asking turk respond american asked turkish imagine please asked rosetta stone wo nt able ll able say hello point people another table make astute observation eating mealit unfortunate program useful resources turkish study quite limited rosetta stone learns incorporate conversational skills sound sla theory programs would suggest avoiding unless money burn
